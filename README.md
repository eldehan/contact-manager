# contact-manager

Contact Manager is a CRUD application for managing contacts, built with the MVC architecture pattern. It uses vanilla JavaScript and the fetch API for AJAX requests, Handlebars as a templating engine and Express.js for the back-end. Data is simply stored in a json file; no database implemented yet.
